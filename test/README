unit tests
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic tests for data structures etc.
build and run:
  make unittest


target tests
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the firmware can be built with a test mode, which makes it send various
information, such as dac value, gate status and current settings, via uart.
this makes it possible to run this test mode firmware on an arduino and verify
that the firmware responds with expected values when you send midi data to it.

currently it's hardcoded to /dev/ttyUSB0, modify it as you like.

build and flash test mode firmware:
  TESTMODE=1 make flash

run tests:
  make targettest
